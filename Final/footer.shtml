    This website is designed for CS100 Course at Calvin College by a Student. All works thereupon this page are thus unsponsored by any company, organization, corporation, industry, and other term that can be used to describe a third party. While using or accessing this website, please keep in mind that the nature of this course is introductory, and by no means extensively involved. Thus, this is not meant to explain anything too in-depth, but rather to just give a general idea to the student working on this project about how the concepts of the nature of the internet and interactive web design works.
